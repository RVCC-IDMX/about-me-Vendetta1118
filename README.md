Welcome! This website will help you get to know me just a little bit better than you may know. Pehaps you don't know me at all. Thats ok! I will be telling you everything you pretty much everything you need to know about me!

## Why Make It? 
Whether you love or hate me I feel as though this website allows you to know me better and is a way I get to express myself in other ways that I wouldn't anywhere else. It allows me to share the side of me that people won't see without truly knowing me. 

## Skill Check 
Using this website I can demonstrate the many skills that I have learned through my time at Raritan Valley Community College, things that make up a website like flexboxes, grids, stylesheets, navbars, input forms, and responsive design are all of my favorite things that I have learned and throughout my website, you will see many of these skills being used!

## Color Scheme 
Many of the colors that I have used I feel, make the page pop out more to the naked eye. Using boring and washed out colors can get people to click away so I really wanted to make it unique and special which is why I used many colors that pop off the page. I used a few Hex codes throughout my page like #AA3957 #269f36 #1b7026 and #00ff22 to really make my website standout from others.
